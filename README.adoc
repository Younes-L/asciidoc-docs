== this readme file is one level above the root directory, which is ROOT

the file to be rendered is file_1 inside the ROOT directory

=== description of the issue :

with this setup :

* the inclusion of file_3 is resolved correctly in file 2,
* the inclusion of file_2 is resolved correctly in file_1, except
* the inclusion of file_3 in file_1 via file_2 is not resolved

=== what made a difference :
writing the full path of file_3 in the include directive of file_2 makes file_3 show up correctly in file_1 

=== what i'm using to convert :
the built-in converter of gitlab.com (for files such as readme, not the converter of GitLab Pages) +
i have not tried using gitlab.com NEXT
