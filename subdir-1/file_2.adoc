== this is file_2
//tag::file_2[]
:path-reference: /subdir-2/subdir-2-1/file_3.adoc

this file is included in file_1 and includes file_3

everything after header is tagged with `file_2` to skip the header when including

the inclusion path is absolute and referenced from an attribute +
`:path-reference: /subdir-2/subdir-2-1/file_3.adoc`

=== file_2 ends here

=== file_3 inclusion (using attribute reference) starts here
(this is where the error is thrown in file_1)

include::{path-reference}[tag=file_3]

=== files_3 inclusion (using attribute reference) ends here

=== file_3 inclusion (using full path) starts here
(this works)

include::/subdir-2/subdir-2-1/file_3.adoc[tag=file_3]
